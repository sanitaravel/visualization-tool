# Task #1

> You are asked to build a mini visualization tool using data from the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com)

## The user should be able to

- See the list of categories (e.g. Sport, Science, History)
- See the distribution of questions by category
- See the distribution of questions by difficulty
- Filter the data to see a single category

## Requirements

- Use at least 50 questions from the API
- Use React functional components and hooks
- Use the Recharts library for charts
- Keep the UI simple, clean, and user-friendly

## Results

- Host the working app as a static page (e.g. github pages)
- Share the links to the source code and the hosted app with us

This will help us assess your abilities to:

- Work with React and real API data
- Iteratively work on a project
- Build a clean and intuitive UI/UX
- Create clear and interactive data visualizations
- Deploy a working prototype
